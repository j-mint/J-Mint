# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there
Welcome to my GitHub profile! 
## About me
I'm Joe and I'm a software developer from Hertfordshire. I enjoy solving problems and learning new things!

I completed a Software Engineering Skills Bootcamp through Aston University in 2022 after experimenting with coding on-and-off in my free time for a couple of years (e.g. doing courses on freeCodeCamp). I wanted to surround myself with people in a similar situation to myself and also fill in any gaps in my knowledge and take my understanding of coding to the next level. I really enjoyed the projects I worked on in the course and it was great to see myself growing more comfortable and confident coding in Java. My favourite project was the final project: a theatre booking system that we produced as a team and gave a presentation on. It was exciting to work on a project with other students and have real client interactions. The presentation went well and I am still in-contact with my team mates to this day. Once the course had finished, my next goal was to see how I could improve the solution. This is what led to me learning java swing: first by following a 'tictactoe' tutorial, then by building a connect4 game and finally leading to the Theatre Booking System V3. Before this I had also completed a couple of SQL courses on Udemy.
