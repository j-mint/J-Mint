# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there
Welcome to my GitHub profile! 
## About me
I'm Joe and I'm a software developer from Hertfordshire. I enjoy solving problems and learning new things!

I completed a Software Engineering Skills Bootcamp through Aston University in 2022 after experimenting with coding on-and-off in my free time for a couple of years (e.g. doing courses on freeCodeCamp). I wanted to surround myself with people in a similar situation to myself and also fill in any gaps in my knowledge and take my understanding of coding to the next level. I really enjoyed the projects I worked on in the course and it was great to see myself growing more comfortable and confident coding in Java. My favourite project was the final project: a theatre booking system that we produced as a team and gave a presentation on. It was exciting to work on a project with other students and have real client interactions. The presentation went well and I am still in-contact with my team mates to this day. Once the course had finished, my next goal was to see how I could improve the solution. This is what led to me learning java swing: first by following a 'tictactoe' tutorial, then by building a connect4 game and finally leading to the Theatre Booking System V3. Before this I had also completed a couple of SQL courses on Udemy.

Outside of coding, I enjoy keeping active. I am aiming to run my first marathon this year. I ran my first 5K on 14/01/2023, first 10K on 18/01/2023 and my first half-marathon (~21.5K) on 05/02/2023.

## I'd like to learn more about:
- Java Swing (currently learning for theatre booking project).
- Unit testing (currently learning for theatre booking project).
- System Development lifecycle.
- Maven/ Spring/ Spring Boot.
- Linux.
- Model View Controller (MVC).
- AWS ([Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1), [study material](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOTamWNgDKc))
- Docker.
- Data structures and algorithms ([course one](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1), [course two](https://sp21.datastructur.es/), [course three](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/video_galleries/lecture-videos/),[course four](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBSGKlAvoiM)).

## Future projects I'd like to work on:
- An application to utilise Web Scraping.
- Airline flight booking system (to expand upon the theatre booking system). Website front end. Use APIs to get real-world flight information and weather forecasts for destinations. SQL backend.
- Secure password generator with customisable character sets and length. 
- Build an API
- Basic web server.
- Project management dashboard.
- Music player.
- ECommerce Web app.
- Instagram clone.

##ðŸ˜Ž Random Java tricks I thought were cool 
1. if statements don't need curly braces surrounding them, although it is probably best practice to include them anyway.
2. If you have a method named toString() in your class, when you print an object made from that class you don't need to write objName.toString() - only objName.
